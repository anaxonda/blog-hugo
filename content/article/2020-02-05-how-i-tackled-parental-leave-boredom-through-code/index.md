Approaching the end of my parental leave, I'll take a moment reflecting on how I tackled the occasional boredom of a longer absence from work.

## Background

I live in Sweden where we have good possibilities for taking long parental leaves. In my case it has been 7 months ‚Äì 8 if I count the summer vacation (a bit shorter than my wife's leave). While I'm absolutely thankful for the possibility to stay home with my daughter and getting to know her, I'll never get a second chance etc etc üôÑ, it's still boring as hell from time to time. Having an ocean of time, but all the time being consumed by baby care was a new and frustrating experience for me. 

What saved me from becoming _chairman of the bored_ was the small technology projects I could work on during the short periods of focus (like when the child was asleep). Problem solving during stroller walks was also a great way to make progress even in days of AFK time (Away From Keyboard).

## What worked for me

Looking back at these months, I'm quite satisfied with the accomplishments. In short:

* [Rebuilt personal website for my wife][4] from WordPress to Gatsby, saving us the annual fee for WordPress.com and ended up with a more personal site.
* Added [dark mode to my own blog][2]
* Added [lazy loading of images on my blog][5]
* Built a [family recipe collection][3] site with a CMS
* Kept the daughter alive (happy and well) üë∂üèª

### Small projects
I think a key success factor was to start small, keep the scope smaller than what you think you'll manage to complete (because you'll be wrong, you'll always be able to do less than what you originally think). 

### MVP
Define a minimal viable product (MVP) and keep track of _nice to have_ stuff separately. When you have other stakeholders, like with my wife's personal website, it can be a good idea to explain the concept of _minimal viable product_ ‚Äì what's simplest version I can build that you can use and we still can kill the old site?

Once the new site was live, I could continue to do the small improvements without time pressure. These were things that was easy to do without longer periods of focus.

### Have your laptop with you
Since you'll need a bag with diapers, change of clothes, food, water and so on, you might as well throw in your laptop when leaving home. That way you can make use of the random chunks of time that appears when the kid falls asleep.

### Ensure you can take notes on the go
