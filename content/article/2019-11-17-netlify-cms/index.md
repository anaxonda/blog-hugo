When I needed a CMS for a Gatsby site, my choice became Netlify CMS. I'll talk about my criteria, pros and cons.

This was a personal website made for a non-technical person (why I needed a CMS at all in the first place) who associates websites with WordPress. She, my wife, is fairly tech savvy, but wouldn't accept editing markdown or other "complicated things". My hypothesis was that I could somewhat compensate for unintuitive features with "on site training".

## Criteria

* Easy to set up authentication/authorisation
* Use Markdown for storage in a location I decide
* Cheap (ideally free)
* Customisable for good user experience
* Good developer experience

## Pros

## Cons

## Conclusion
