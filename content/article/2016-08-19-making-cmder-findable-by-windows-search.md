This is just a short reminder for myself. I just found myself reinstalling Windows and thus also my favourite console, [Cmder][1]. I didn't remember what to do to make it findable by Windows search, so here's how:

## 1. Add path to PATH environment variable

This can be either for your specific user or for the whole system.

## 2. Log off and on again

## 3. Voilà!
