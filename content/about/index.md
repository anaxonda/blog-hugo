# Hi, I'm Henrik!

{{<post-image image="henrik-1.jpg" width="400" alt="Bald guy smiling" />}}

I enjoy exploring computer stuff for business and pleasure. I live in Stockholm, Sweden with a wife and a daughter, working for [Academic Work][1] as a programmer and team manager.

## Open to "New Opportunities"

Five hours after returning to my job from [my parental leave][3], filled with energy and enthusiasm, it became apparent that I should consider another employment.

I enjoy working in prestigeless environments with people who respect one another. Having worked with a diverse set of people I've always found something to learn from them. Hopefully they've also found something to learn from me.

Being a developer by heart and having seen too many hacks around big enterprise platforms (SharePoint, Adapt, SAP), it comes natural to me to prefer build over buy. Buying products and services as a piece of a puzzle is many times the best choice, as long as you own the puzzle, in contrast to buying a puzzle an trying to make your own pieces fit.

I also like questioning the defaults. Having spent most of my career in the Microsoft ecosystem, I now prefer the JavaScript ecosystem (such as React/Angular/Vue/Svelte and Node). At least for now, this is a more exciting world in my mind. I still enjoy C# and am happy to choose a Microsoft technology or service, as long as it's the best option, not because it's [the default][2].

I'd say I'm stronger in front-end than back-end these days, but I like both.

I'm not in a hurry to find a new job, but if you have something interesting, I'm listening. As a recruiter, you'll recognise the LinkedIn logo below ðŸ˜‰ As a techie, you'll recognise the GitHub link â€“ in case you want to judge my coding style in personal projects.
