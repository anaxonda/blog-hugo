# Hi, I'm Henrik! 

{{<figure src="/images/henrik-1.jpg" class="image-border" width="300" alt="Bald guy smiling">}}

I enjoy exploring computer stuff for business and pleasure. 

I live in Stockholm, Sweden and since 2015 (when I got married) my last name is _Sommerfeld_. I am a programmer working at [Academic Work][1] where I manage a small development team working on various internal systems. When writing this I'm new to the job and really looking forward to it.
